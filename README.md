## Design Principles

This project follows modern web design best practices inspired by clean, elegant component libraries:

- **Typography:** Uses the Poppins font for a bold, readable, and contemporary look.
- **Color Palette:** Vibrant gradients and harmonious accent colors deliver a fresh, attractive interface.
- **3D Aesthetics:** Employs CSS box shadows, 3D transforms, and perspective properties for depth and realism.
- **Whitespace & Layout:** Generous padding and consistent spacing create a breathable, uncluttered layout.
- **Smooth Transitions:** Micro-animations and hover effects improve interactivity without distraction.
- **Dark Mode:** Provides a soft dark background with balanced contrast and vibrant highlights.

## Technology Stack

- HTML5 with semantic ARIA roles for accessibility
- CSS3 with custom properties, gradients, 3D transforms, and transitions
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) for calculator logic and theme toggling
